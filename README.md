# InsectKiller
First app for Vision OS

I was curious about how it's like to develop an app for VisionOS and decided to develop a funny game for my son 😃 insect killer. 🐞

I was able to develop that very quickly, in less than 4 hours, and the positive experience was that I didn't see any noticeable difference between developing code for Vision OS and the iOS.
It was at least easier than developing app for tvOS. 😀
